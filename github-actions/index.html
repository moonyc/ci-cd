    <h1>GitHub Actions</h1>
    <h2> Key Elements and First Workflow</h2>
    <p> "the road not taken looks real good now"</p>

    <p>GitHub Actions is a workflow automation service offered by GitHub: <br/>
    it can automate all kind of possible repository processes. <br/>
    You need to understand <span>three</span> fundamental building blocks to efficiently integrate <br/>
    the service in our pipelines: <span>workflows, jobs and steps</span>. <br/>
    Workflows, jobs and steps are related to each other and to the code repository like this: 
    </p>

    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>The workflows are attached to the repositories. <br/>
        You can add as many workflows as you want to a given repository.</li>
        <li>Workflows contain one or more jobs.</li>
        <li>Jobs contain one or more Steps</li>
        <li>Every job defines a runner, which is the environment, ergo <br/> 
          the operating system used to execute the steps.</li>
        <li>GitHub offer runners for Linux, Mac OS and Windows, but you can configure <br/>
        your runners.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple jobs, they run in parallel by default <br/>
        but you can configure them to run in a sequential order.</li>
        <li>You can setup conditional jobs.</li>
        <li>Steps define the actual commands that will be executed.</li>
        <li>A steps is a shell script or an Action.</li>
        <li>Actions are predefined script that perform a certain task</li>
        <li>Steps are executed in sequential order.</li>
        <li>Steps can be conditional</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>We build workflows to automate processes, consequentially <br/>
    we assign a trigger (or event) to each workflow, so that we're able to regulate <br/>
    their execution's recurrence. An <span>event </span>could require manual activation, <br/>
    but you could also trigger the workflow whenever a commit is pushed to a certain branch.</p>
    
    <h2>A Simple Example:</h2>
    <div>
      <p><span>name:</span> Basic Workflow <br/>
        <code>// This means that you will have to trigger it manually:</code> <br/>
        <span>on:</span> workflow_dispatch <br/>
        <span>jobs:</span> <br/>
        <code>// Press tab to intend correctly:</code> <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbspjob:</span> <br/>
        <code>// Search "GitHub Actions runners"</code> <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspruns-on:</span> ubuntu-lates <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsteps:</span> <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- name:</span> Print Hello <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprun:</span> echo "Hello Sasha" <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- name:</span> Print Goodbye <br/>
        <span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprun:</span> echo "Goodbye Sasha"
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Artifacts, Jobs Output, Cache dependencies</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Artifacts are Outputs assets generated by jobs</li>
        <li>Artifacts are a way to store output assets.
        <li>Artifacts are files and folders generated by a job, that we want to use 
          or inspect in other jobs </li>
        <li>We can manually download and use artifacts: via github ui or rest apis</li>
        <li>We can download and use artifacts in other jobs: via action</li>
        <li>Jobs can output simple value that we might wanna use in a subsequent job. 
          A Job Output could be any kind of value that we want to make available across job.
        </li>
        <li>We can cache dependencies</li>
        <li>Cached dependencies are used across workflow executions</li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Important To Note:</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Actions and Workflows are not synonimous.</li>
        <li>Pull Requests based on forks do <span>NOT</span> trigger a workflow.</li>
        <li>Workflows get deleted if Jobs fail</li>
        <li>A job fails if at least one step fails</li>
        <li>Workflows can be cancelled manually</li>
        <li>Workflows can be skipped manually</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    Spring breaks loose, the time is near."
