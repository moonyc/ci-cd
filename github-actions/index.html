    <h1>GitHub Actions</h1>
    <h2> Key Elements and First Workflow</h2>
    <p> "the road not taken looks real good now"</p>

    <p>GitHub Actions is a workflow automation service offered by GitHub: <br/>
    it can automate all kind of possible repository processes. <br/>
    We need to understand <span>three</span> fundamental building blocks to efficiently integrate <br/>
    the service in our pipelines: <span>workflows, jobs and steps</span>. <br/>
    Workflows, jobs and steps are related to each other and to the code repository like this: 
    </p>

    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>The workflows are attached to the repositories. <br/>
        You can add as many workflows as you want to a given repository.</li>
        <li>Workflows contain one or more jobs.</li>
        <li>Jobs contain one or more Steps</li>
        <li>Steps define the actual commands that will be executed.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>We build workflows to automate processes, consequentially <br/>
    we assign a trigger (or event) to each workflow, so that we're able to regulate <br/>
    their execution's recurrence. An event could require manual activation, <br/>
    but you could also trigger the a workflow whenever a commit is pushed to a certain branch.</p>
